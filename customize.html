    <h1>What are costumes?</h1>
    <img src="images/custom.jpg" alt="custom" width="300">
    <p>Costumes are custom made outfits that can we worn by players in custom rooms. Costumes are created by adding maker pen shapes to a costume dummy, this will then allow people to wear the maker pen shapes. The costume dummy is made up of 4 segments, Head, body, left hand and right hand: each of these sections can be edited individually Costumes can also be saved as inventions and uploaded to the invention store for others to download and use.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <h1>Spawning a costume dummy</h1>
    <p>A costume dummy can be spawned from your maker pen while in your custom room. To spawn a dummy grab your maker pen, open the maker pen menu and then open the maker pen palette. On the palette menu go to Props -> dynamic -> costume dummy. You can now spawn and place your costume dummy. </p>
	&nbsp;
    <h1>Full Body Costumes</h1>
    <p>Full body costume dummies feature arms and legs with inverse kinematics (IK). This allows them to move more like real people or like how characters in other traditional and VR games move. These full body costumes have 17 different segments for you to attach maker pen shapes to. See the video above for more information. </p>
